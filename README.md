# Hello, OpenAI!

## Getting started
To use OpenAI, you will need to create an OpenAI account. OpenAI currently maintains an application [waitlist](https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30), and it may take a few weeks to access.
Once access is granted, it is recommended to check out the [playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).
